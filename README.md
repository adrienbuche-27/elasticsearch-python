# elasticsearch-python

Within this repository, I'll explore how to efficiently use Elasticsearch within python, first using script and then developping a User Inteface to do Web scraping and interacting with the data stored in Elasticsearch.

 ## Launching ElasticSearch & Kibana

 from the terminal, navigate to the ElasticSearch folder, then run

 `bin\elasticsearch` to start the ElasticSearch instance.

 Once Elasticsearch is running, we have to launch Kibana, which is the UI for exploring ElasticSearch. Similarly to elasticsearch, we activate kibana using the following command:

 `bin\kibana`

 By default, Elasticsearch is available at local host 9200 and kibana is available at local host 5601.
