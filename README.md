Throughout this porject, I want to stregthen my knowlegde of Elasticsearch while building a intuitive UI application with Dash to interact with Elasticsearch indices.


# Launching ElasticSearch & Dash

To use the application, you will have to start the Elasticsearch Instance and then run the Dash App.

## Elasticsearch

After downloading the Elasticsearch [here](https://www.elastic.co/fr/downloads/elasticsearch) and placing the unzipped directory within the current project, run the following command to start Elasticsearch.

 `bin\elasticsearch`

`python3 app.py`
